# React Boilerplate

This is a simple Boilerplate which serves as a starting point for creating React apps using `webpack`, `webpack-dev-server`, `sass`, `babel` and `babel presets` for `react` and `ES6/7`.

### Add Project Dependencies

Run the following commands in your terminal in the order they are written:
- `git clone __dir__ __repo-url__`
- `cd __dir__`
#### If you use "npm" :
- `npm install --save react react-dom`
- `npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react babel-preset-stage-1 css-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin html-webpack-plugin node-sass sass-loader style-loader webpack webpack-dev-server`
#### If you use "yarn" :
- `yarn add react react-dom`
- `yarn add --dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react babel-preset-stage-1 css-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin html-webpack-plugin node-sass sass-loader style-loader webpack webpack-dev-server`

### Run the App in Browser

Run the following command in your terminal after you have run the previous commands:
- `npm start` and it will open the app in your default browser.

#### Add new packages and files in your app to suit your project needs.
