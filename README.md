# React Boilerplate

This is a simple Boilerplate which serves as a starting point for creating React apps using `webpack`, `webpack-dev-server`, `sass`, `babel` and `babel presets` for `react` and `ES6/7`.

### Start

Run the following commands in your terminal in the order they are written:
- `git clone __dir__ __repo-url__`
- `cd __dir__`
- `npm install --save react react-dom`
- `npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react css-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin html-webpack-plugin node-sass sass-loader style-loader webpack webpack-dev-server`
- `npm start` and it will open the browser with a HTML page.

Feel free to add new packages and files to scale the app.
